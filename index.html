                Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up 
                the entire width of the browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views:
                desktop, tablet, and mobile. To make the section really tall, you can either fill it 
                out with a LOT of text or simply set its height to something like 1000px. It needs to 
                be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view the bottom of the section. 
                Make sure its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the content. 
                (Hint: don't forget to have an element with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' 
                wrapping your grid. Remember that to have the grid do something "always", i.e., no matter what 
                browser window size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we want the section to take 
                up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)
